## üíæ **DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Per Service Pattern**
```yaml
Database Strategy: One PostgreSQL instance with separate schemas

Schemas:
  - user_management (users, profiles, sessions)
  - communities (communities, spaces, members)
  - content (posts, comments, reactions)
  - messaging (conversations, messages)
  - events (events, attendees, streams)
  - courses (courses, modules, progress)
  - notifications (notifications, preferences)
  - analytics (events, metrics)
  - payments (subscriptions, transactions)
  - ai_automation (agents, rules, interactions)
```

### **Data Consistency Strategy**
```yaml
Consistency Approach:
  - ACID transactions within service boundaries
  - Eventual consistency between services
  - Event-driven data synchronization
  - Saga pattern for complex workflows

Event Store:
  - PostgreSQL with event sourcing tables
  - Redis for real-time event distribution
  - Webhook system for external integrations
```

---

## üîê **SECURITY ARCHITECTURE**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
```yaml
Authentication:
  - JWT tokens (short-lived access tokens)
  - Refresh tokens (long-lived, stored securely)
  - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
  - Multi-factor authentication

Authorization:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Resource-based permissions
  - Community-level permissions
  - API rate limiting

Security Measures:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - CSRF tokens
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
```

---

## üì± **MOBILE APP ARCHITECTURE**

### **Frontend Architecture**
```yaml
Architecture Pattern: Feature-Based Modules

App Structure:
  /src
    /shared (common components, hooks, utils)
    /features
      /auth (login, register, profile)
      /communities (list, details, management)
      /discussions (posts, comments, reactions)
      /messaging (chat interface, conversations)
      /events (calendar, details, streaming)
      /courses (lessons, progress, certificates)
      /directory (member search, connections)
    /navigation (Expo Router configuration)
    /store (Zustand stores)
    /api (TanStack Query + Axios)

State Management:
  - Zustand for global state
  - TanStack Query for server state
  - React Hook Form for form state
  - AsyncStorage for persistence
```

---

## üîÑ **API DESIGN PATTERNS**

### **RESTful API Standards**
```yaml
API Design:
  - RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
  - HTTP status codes for responses
  - Pagination for list endpoints
  - Filtering and sorting capabilities
  - API versioning (v1, v2, etc.)

Response Format:
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {},
    "message": "Success message",
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 100
    }
  }

Error Format:
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "Invalid input data",
      "details": []
    }
  }
```

---

## üìà **SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Horizontal Scaling Strategy**
```yaml
Scaling Approach:
  - Stateless microservices
  - Database connection pooling
  - Redis for caching and sessions
  - CDN for static assets
  - Load balancing across service instances

Performance Optimizations:
  - Database indexing strategy
  - Query optimization
  - Caching layers (Redis, CDN)
  - Image optimization and compression
  - Real-time connection management
```

---

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for building a Circle.so-like community platform with enterprise-grade scalability, security, and feature completeness. The modular microservices approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.
