### 🛠️ Technology-Specific Implementation Guidelines

#### **Mobile App Development Best Practices**

**React Native Structure**
```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
├── screens/           # Screen components
├── navigation/        # Navigation configuration
├── services/         # API services and utilities
├── store/            # State management
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── utils/            # Helper functions
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── assets/           # Images, fonts, etc.
```

**State Management Strategy**
- Global state: User authentication, app settings
- Local state: Form inputs, UI interactions
- Server state: API data caching with React Query
- Persistent state: AsyncStorage for offline data

#### **Backend Development Best Practices**

**Microservice Structure**
```
auth-service/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/   # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── services/      # Business logic
│   ├── repositories/  # Data access layer
│   ├── models/        # Data models/entities
│   ├── middleware/    # Custom middleware
│   ├── guards/        # Authentication guards
│   └── utils/         # Helper functions
├── test/              # Test files
├── Dockerfile         # Container configuration
└── docker-compose.yml # Local development
```

**API Design Principles**
- RESTful endpoints with clear naming
- Consistent error handling and status codes
- Comprehensive input validation
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Comprehensive API documentation
